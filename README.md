# Lots of Balls

This readme will give you the directions needed to get started with the assignment for today.
First, a quick overview:
 1. Fork this repository
 2. Clone your forked repository so you have a local repository
 3. Follow along with our class assignment, commiting and syncing along with the class
 4. To submit, create a pull request

## Forking
Forking is pretty simple. At the top of this page, you'll see a button that says "Fork". Click it. Once you've done that, a copy of the repository will be created for your account.

## Cloning
You'll need a local repository so you can work on this assignment.
 1. Open the GitHub GUI and make sure you're signed in.
 2. Click the plus sign in the top left corner
  * Choose the "Clone" option
  * The repository you just forked will be an option. Select it and choose "Clone"
  * Select a location to clone it to. Please do not clone to a flash drive - this has caused unusual results in the past. The computer hard drive is fine, because your files will be safely backed up to the server

## Pull Request
In a software development context, a Pull Request in Git is how somebody who's working on a project owned by somebody else can request that the owner of the project reviews the changes they've made and consider adding them to the owner's code. This is essentially what we'll be doing as well. I probably won't be merging your changes into my repository, but when you are done you will create a pull request to let me know you're ready to be graded. When we get through this assignment, I'll go through Pull Requests and update this accordingly

# Goals for this assignment
In this assignment, we're going to create many bouncing balls. In the process of doing so, we'll be reviewing for loops, reviewing Git, and introducing arrays.

# Do Now: Day 1
Fork this repository and clone it so you have a local repository. Add a second ball to the code. Commit as "Added a second ball"
